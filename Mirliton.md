## CHARGING

TOBUY: Extra Battery. NEW SOUNDCARD? BORROW MAC?

Buy a powerbank.

## LEVELS

BASS DRUM IS TOO LOUD. NEED TO PLAY QUIETLY. 

## AMP

CAN USE SPEAKER?
BUY LONG CABLES!
SPEAKER MUST BE A LONG WAY AWAY. 

## TONE. USE DRAPES! USE A DOU-LI?

- BAMBOO WIND / SOUND PROTECTOR. 
- IMPORTANT: WILL NEED CLOTHS TO DAMPEN THINGS. 
- EXPERIMENT WITH DISTANCE AND PLACEMENT.
- FOR OUTSIDE, MAKE A HOMEMADE ISOLATION CABINET.

Can already be used for homerecordings. 


## POST-EQ

## Conceptual

- DON'T NEED TO USE FOR MORE THAN ONE SONG AT A TIME. DON'T OVERDO IT?!?!?!
- HAVE TWO BROWSER WINDOWS OPEN.


OR BRING ALONG LAPTOP CABLE TO CHARGE

OR USE OTHER PEOPLE'S PHONE

MAKE SURE SPEAKERS ARE PLACED AWAY.

DRUMS ARE TOO SENSITIVE

SPEAKERS WILL NEED TO BE A LONG WAY FORM MIC.

NEED TO BE ISOLATED SOMEHOW.
