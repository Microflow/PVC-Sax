#### We're bulding a Recorder / Bassoon with a Sax Mouthpiece

As this instrument has no keys, it's technically a recorder. A friend said it was a "soprano bassoon".

We're using the sax mouthiece for a better tone.

We can research "DIY recorders" to understand hole theory.



# Measurements

### Drill bit hole size from the above video.

#### NOTE: There are a couple of typos, which I preserved, because I wasn't sure exactly what he was saying..

- The pipe is 19 1/2 inches long,

- The diameter of the pipe is 1 inch, 

- There is a 1 1/2 distance from the center of the first top three holes 
so each doubt that you make for your first three holes should be 1 1/2 inch apart. 

- NOTE: What did he mistype with "doubt"?

- NOTE: FIRST THREE HOLES 1 and 1/2 inch apart.

- Hole 4 should be 1 and 5/8 inches from the 3rd hole, 
the 5th hole should be the same, along with the 6th hole. 

- NOTE: LAST THREE HOLES 1 and 5/8 inches apart?

### Drill bit hole size: 

- The first three holes, 1/2 drill bit, 
- The fourth hole, 3/8 drillbit 
- Hole 5 and 6, 1/2 drillbit.

## PVC Sax Materials: 

#### From the first vid.

- The pipe is made from a piece of PVC 
- The saxophone mouthpiece I bought from a music store
- The rubber cap  holding on the saxophone mouthpiece can be bought from any hardware store
- **The copper elbow tubing goes into the saxophone mouthpiece.** 

## What to Buy on Day 1

1) Beginner large alto mouthpiece. 2) 2 reed. 3) alto ligature.

A Yamaha 4C is the standard and are like $25 but you might find cheaper brands in Taiwan.  Ligatures can be real cheap like $5 $10 tops.  Reeds are all the same unless you drop tons of cash
 
Like you can buy plastic coated bamboo reeds from Japan or weird synthetic French stuff but every other Reed sounds the same to me and most people just use normal reeds, even at professional levels of playing


### Hole Size Theory

###### You can finely adjust tone hole size using a knife.

#### Yamaha Primer on Hole Measurement Basics.

A little wordy, but good.

*- The tone holes of a recorder tend to be thought of as being positioned at regular intervals, but that is not actually the case.

- They are not at regular intervals, nor are they all positioned in a straight line. 
- The holes are not in a straight line because they are positioned so as to be easier to cover with the fingers.
- In fact, providing they are positioned at the same height in the bore, the same pitch of sound will be produced irrespective of where they are placed on a circumference of the bore at that height. 
- If you try stretching your fingers, you will find that on the human hand, the middle finger and the ring finger are harder to stretch than other fingers. 
- Therefore, for the position of the holes on a recorder, the space between holes covered by the middle finger and the ring finger is also minimized.
- In accordance with the closely related pitch of the notes and size of the holes, the locations for all of the holes have been precisely adjusted so as to be easy to cover with the fingers.*

** To give an example of the relationship between the positions of the tone holes and their size, if the position of the hole is moved farther down the bore of the recorder, the pitch of the sound can only be preserved by making the hole bigger. Conversely, when the hole is repositioned higher up the bore, it will be designed to be smaller.** 

#### For a wooden recorder, if the pitch is found to be very slightly out during the final tuning, the size of the hole will be finely adjusted using a knife.

### Best Reeds

- Whats the best reed for a breathy, dark, blusy sound...?
Thu 10:16 PM

- Thicker reeds but the mouthpiece effects it a lot too

- Well, stronger... they aren't always technically thicker

- They come in strengths but I can't blow anything above a 3 effectively.  A beginner Reed is a 2 and 2.5 is most common
- I've also had some success with a 1.5 but only in the lower registers of a soprano, but it has some interesting "spooky" potential
1:16 AM

- 2.5 or 1.5, got it. Cheers.

- For a dark sound 3+

- 
- 1.5 sounds spooky in a way it's a light sound

- Sound quality will probably suck if it's made from PvC.  Mouth pieces range from $20 to $800 or more

 
- I mean if you want to learn a 2 is the easiest to find and start with
3:51 AM
- But unless his instructions are really specific you'll have to go through 100 pipes, also soprano sax is one of the hardest ones

- Ideally you should start on an alto or tenor

 
- Or even a clarinet
- If the sound holes aren't perfect it just gets even harder
Also mouthpiece, 2 Reed and an alto mouthpiece ligature

so that is three things?

Don't try to learn on 2.5 yourouth won't handle it for more than a few minutes

 
Mouth*

ok, so... 2



## Start with a no hole pipe

- Yeah that's a problem... one other idea might be to get an extra pipe with no holes.  If you get a squeak from just the mouthpiece, then some kinda honk from a straight pipe (I have no idea what it'd sound like) then you can compare that to a drilled pipe

- why should I try with a no hole pvc pipe. As a comparison. I can half see your logic...

- What am I aiming for? (PVC is cheap, so I will try what you said)

- Just so that you have a frame of reference... so much might go wrong with a home made instrument

sure, I get it
 
- Like, the no hope pipe might not work well either but more references means better troubleshooting

- Also is this design one pipe or multiple pipes

- So with no holes, you're expecting...? just a honk... OK, I see your logic

## How will one pipe sound?
 
- Some kind of low note is my guess

- multiple pipe looks lame, is more difficult, and more could go wrong

- But like, then you can compare it to how you're plugging the holesnwith your fingers

- Ya one pipe is probably better
